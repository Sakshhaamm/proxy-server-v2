## ✨ Features
* **Concurrency:** Handles multiple client connections simultaneously using a thread pool/threading model[cite: 10, 49].
* **HTTP Forwarding:** Parses and relays HTTP GET and HEAD requests to destination servers[cite: 11].
* **Traffic Filtering:** Blocks access to specific domains listed in a blacklist configuration file[cite: 12, 70].
* **Access Logging:** Records detailed logs of all traffic, including timestamps, client IPs, and action status (ALLOWED/BLOCKED)[cite: 78].
* **Configurable:** Port, thread limits, and blocking rules can be easily modified.
